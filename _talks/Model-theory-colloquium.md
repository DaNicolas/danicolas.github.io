**Abstract:** Oftentimes in mathematics, especially algebra, statements are made which are inherently of a finite nature, even if they apply to infinite objects. In such situations, model-theoretic techniques can often provide an insightful and elegant way to argue why such statements hold, or why they carry over from some (infinite) objects to others. The goal of this talk is to introduce some of these techniques in a way that is accessible and ready-to-use for algebraists, and apply them to prove a classical result from algebra/algebraic geometry: the Ax-Grothendieck Theorem.

This talk was given at the [Antwerp Algebra Colloquium](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/pure-mathematics/research/ongoing-scientific-events/antwerp-algebra-colloquium/).
