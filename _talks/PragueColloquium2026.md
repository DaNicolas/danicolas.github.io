**Abstract:** Many properties of a field (or of some of its elements) can be captured by asking whether certain polynomial equations have solutions in the field. Examples include statements like "$x$ can be written as a sum of two cubes" ($x = y^3 + z^3$) or “some non-zero element is simultaneously a square and minus a square’’ ($zy^2 = 1 = -zw^2$). When given such a property, what is its most efficient description via polynomial equations, that is, with the lowest number of variables?  
Model theory offers a helpful perspective through results known as preservation theorems. These (meta)theorems reflect a simple guiding idea: if a property behaves like it comes from a certain kind of description, then it actually does. To use a known trope: if it looks, swims, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  
I will introduce some famous preservation theorems, and a less famous one which presents a way to think about the problem from the first paragraph. If there is time, I will also touch on a more geometric viewpoint on this problem, and some surprisingly simple related open questions.  
This talk is partially based on joint work with Arno Fehm and Philip Dittmann.
