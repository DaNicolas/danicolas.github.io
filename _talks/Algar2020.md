In 2020, I was one of the main speakers at the yearly summer school [Algebra and Arithmetic (ALGAR)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-winter-schools/algar/), which in that year had as its topic [Valuations, quadratic forms, and definability](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/summer-winter-schools/algar/programme/previous-editions/2020/).  
The summer school took place online this year, and the talks have been recorded and are made available.
Below you may find the slides and recordings of my talks.
