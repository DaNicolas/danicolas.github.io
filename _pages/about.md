Hi! I'm a mathematics researcher, currently employed as a postdoc at [Charles University - Faculty of Mathematics](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) in the number theory research group ("UFOCLAN") led by [Vita Kala](https://www1.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~kala/web/), and supported by a PRIMUS grant under supervision of Pavlo Yatsyna.
My research focuses on questions from field theory and number theory in the broad sense, and in particular connections between valuation theory, quadratic form theory, arithmetic geometry, and model theory.

On this website you may find links to my publications and preprints, slides and sometimes recordings of talks I have given, as well as material supporting courses I teach or have taught in the past.
